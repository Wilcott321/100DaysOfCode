# 100DaysOfCode
### Code for at least an hour today, share repos, record challenges to overcome them, and repeat the next day

## About
Crediting Richard Littauer and [his medium post](https://medium.com/@richlitt/100-days-of-code-5e9a4dc6d56b) where he shared experiences contributing meaningful code, many webdev noobs have been inspired to embark on their own 100-day challenges. I code everyday but I'm rarely willing to share my work via public repos or write about the process consistently. Like Littauer, I feel like the challenge would make me more accountable, and improve my comfortability with using git as version control. Therefore, I'm diving in and welcome anyone who wants to join me.

## Specs
For everyday I code, I will post, update, and share a repo of what I did that day. The only exception would be if I'm working on a private project (for a client), or I do not have permission to share a contribution from the authorizing body (for proprietary or academic reasons). In the case of the latter, I may only share a few code snippets, or a blog link to a post where I wrote about the project.

## How You Can Contribute
I will link what I've done for the day below. You may wish to clone this repo and add your own links to projects you work on as well in joining me for the challenge. Just include your username, followed by a link to your own repo under **Contributers**.

## Update
On April 26, 2016 I decided to end this challenge. I skipped over 11 days and could not find the time to code everyday for a challenge that is not work-related. Blog post on my experience coming soon.
